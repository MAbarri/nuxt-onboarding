The project uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/){target="_blank"} as the database ORM and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/){target="_blank"} as the database.

## Database URL

I recommend using [Neon](https://www.neon.tech){target="_blank"} for your database hosting who provides a free tier for development.
Wathever you can use any other provider or host your database on your own server, for example via Docker.

You need to set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file.

```json [.env]
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/database
```


## Push the schema to the database

After setting the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, you can push the schema to the database by running the following command:

```bash [Terminal]
pnpm run prisma:push
```

This command will create the tables in the database based on the schema defined in the `prisma/schema.prisma` file.
